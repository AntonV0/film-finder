# Film Finder
## Project #42 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to create a movie discovery app that recommends random movies by genre, using HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript. This project implements The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
## What I Learned
  - How to fetch information from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in JavaScript
  - Asynchronous functions that return a promise
  - try/catch statements to catch and handle errors
  - Converting response objects to a JSON object (to get the requested data)
